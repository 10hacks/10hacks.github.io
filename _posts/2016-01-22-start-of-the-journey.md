A new year begins, and after traveling, sickness, and getting caught up a bit, it's time to 
kick things into high gear. 2015 was an amazing year of growth. I wrote a book, helped launch
a startup, and a ton of other stuff. Mostly, it was a big year for personal growth and learning.
This year, it's all about pulling together the past 10 years of experience and turning it into
something of my own. Something great.

10Hacks is where I'll be documenting progress and sharing what I learn.

OK, back to work. More to come.
